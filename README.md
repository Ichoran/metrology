# Metrology - Worm Health Monitoring

Metrology is a small utility to extract specific parameters from pre-defined
Choreography runs on _C. elegans_ experiments analyzed with the Multi-Worm
Tracker.

Specifically, it is designed to extract per-animal scores from a standard
behavioral assay consisting of a five minute recording, twelve taps
delivered at a ten-second inter-stimulus interval, and a brief cooldown.

As the assay changes, the code itself will be changed, with previous
branches typically being archived in a fork.
